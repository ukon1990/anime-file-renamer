  <Overview>As the crew searches for Zoro, Sanji follows Maya, a girl of the island, to a village. There, Zoro appears, accompanied by a group of marines. Zoro wields his sword against Sanji and takes three jewel balls from Maya. Luffy stumbles upon a training center of the local navy division. There, he encounters Saga, the leader of the center and owner of the Seven Star Sword, who made Zoro take the balls to revive that swords slumbering power. Luffy fights him, but falls from a cliff. The Seven Stars Sword was that, which had ruined the country of Asuka with its cursed power a long time ago and had therefore been sealed. But with a night of a red full moon, that occurs only once every hundred years, the jewel balls in his possession, and Zoro on his side, only the remaining Straw Hats stand in Saga's way to reviving the swords true power.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats visits an island, known as Mecha Island, where a fisherman sings an old folk song about a Golden Crown. Searching for that mysterious treasure, they find a hidden entrance into the island. The island's leader, Ratchet, impressed with the find and in search of the Golden Crown himself, invites the crew to join him in his search and the crew along with Ratchet and his henchmen enter the cave. As it turns out, the islands true form, is that of a giant turtle. Ratchet, who had known this all along, uses his mechanical castle to take control of the turtle, in order to use it, to take over the world. Now the Straw Hats have to stop not only Ratchet, but also the helpless turtle, from crashing into a nearby island.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Romance Dawn anime remake retells the story of Romance Dawn V.1. This remake occurs after the Thriller Bark Arc and before the Sabaody Archipelago arc in the anime series. As such, all 9 members of the Straw Hat crew are present, as oppose to the original story, which only featured Luffy.

The Straw Hat Pirates run out of food stocks, and Luffy was sent out on the Mini-Merry, only to get lost and drift off course. Luffy arrives at an island to venture out in search of replenishing their provisions. He encounters a girl named Silk, who has mistaken Luffy as a pirate from Crescent-Moon Galley's crew. Galley, who was tied up on his ship by Luffy, has threatened her town and Luffy promises Silk that he'll help her defeat him. After a short fight, Luffy makes short work of the Crescent-Moon Galley, while explaining to Silk about his abilities. After Galley runs off, Luffy remembers he left the Mini-Merry tied to Galley's ship. On his way back, the Mayor and various townspeople, mistake Luffy for Galley. They proceed to subdue him and tie him up. As he tries to explain himself, Galley interferes and attacks Silk. Galley, Silk and Luffy trade words about the meaning of treasure. Galley proceeds to throw Luffy's straw hat into the nearby ocean. Luffy stretches to get, with his head extending, but falls short and into the water. Silk dives in, rescues him, and curses Galley for sailing away. As they leave, Galley orders an attack on the island, destroying several buildings. Luffy slingshots himself towards Galley's ship, only to by shot out of the air by a cannon ball.

Falling towards the water, Luffy is saved the Thousand Sunny and the other Straw Hats. Usopp, Sanji, Nami &amp; Zoro berate Luffy on his being lost, while a fight breaks out on Galley's ship. After some fighting, Galley is given a wanted poster of Luffy, comparing Luffy's 300,000,000 Beli to his small 5,000,000. Luffy proceeds to wreck Galley's ship with his Gear 3rd, Giganto Ax (oddly he doesn't shrink afterwards like he usally does after using Gear Third). Luffy then grabs Galley and lands on a piece of his wreaked ship while his crew sail away with the Cresent Moon's provisons and treasure. Galley swears he'll kill Luffy someday, who ignores him and hits him with his pistol move sending Galley flying into the distance. After the battle, the Straw Hats give the townpeoples the treasure they took from Galley's ship to rebuild their town while the crew sail on. Silk paints a Straw Hat next to a rainbow on her rebuilt diner in honor of Luffy as the special ends. </Overview>

  <Overview>In a thick bank of fog, the Straw Hats run into a fleet of navy ships. Surprised by the sight of the skull and crossbones on the pirate ship's sails, the young trainee cook Tajiyo falls off of his navy vessel. Robin catches him before he hits the water and the boy regains consciousness in the Straw Hats' cabin. Scared at first, he loosens up when presented by Sanji with a soup of surprising quality. The small cook reveals his problem: he spilled the day's production of curry and has been charged with replacing it. To compound the issue, the fleet's captains plan to dine aboard his ship. Luffy and Sanji take Tajiyo back to his ship, where Sanji provides him with subtle cooking advice. Tajiyo's new curry turns out perfectly and the Straw Hats escape before the fog lifts in the mid-day sun. </Overview>

  <Overview>Before he meets Luffy, Zoro traveled the world in search of &quot;Hawk-Eye&quot; Mihawk. In a flashback, Zoro captures the target of the bounty hunters Johnny and Yosaku in a bar. According to bounty hunter rules, they demand that he relinquish the victim's body to them. Zoro, who does not consider himself a bounty hunter, complies, explaining that he only brings in a bounty from time to time so that he can survive until he can become the greatest swordsman in the world. Later that day, a group of bandits, led by a man with a much higher bounty, plunders the village. Johnny and Yosaku, inspired by Zoro's conviction, decide to take on the villain, but are quickly defeated. As the bandits prepare to kill the pair, Zoro returns and saves Johnny and Yosaku. After he defeats the bandits and their leader, Johnny and Yosaku become his followers. </Overview>

  <Overview>A few navy ships chase the Straw Hats. To escape them, the Straw Hats sail through an area of wild currents, which surround an island that is only inhabited by an old man named Zenii and his goats. Zenii realizes that the Straw Hats are pirates and sends his goats to attack them. During the fight Zenii's heart stops from fear. The Straw Hats take him to his home, nurse him back to health, and complete his chores, such as cleaning his house, preparing meals, and chopping wood. Zoro searches for food and discovers a small nearly completed pirate ship atop the island's mountain. At the day's end, as the crew is about to leave, Chopper reveals that the old man will die within three days. Driven by guilt, the Straw Hats decide to stay with him until then. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats continue to do Zenii's daily work and finish building his pirate ship, which he intends to use as a coffin. Zoro eventually realizes that the three days until Zenii's death, which Chopper had diagnosed, have long passed, but by the time he convinces the others to leave, Nami has already lost the Straw Hats' ship in a game of chess. Robin wins it back and they all have a party. As Zenii becomes drunk, he recollects his past as a moneylender who lent money to pirates. He describes how he was shipwrecked twenty years earlier, and that he, in hopes of one day becoming a pirate, started building a ship. As the years passed, he became too old for a pirate's life. Luffy disagrees, saying that pirates can be of any age. The next day, a group of marines lures the Straw Hats into a trap. To save them, Zenii and his goats ride his ship down the mountainside. </Overview>

  <Overview>The commotion caused by Zenii's arrival allows Nami, Sanji, Usopp, and Chopper to board their ship safely. Zenii and his goats get on the navy ship and Zenii uses of his martial arts skills, with a counting frame to fight. Luffy attempts to slingshot himself over to help him, but lands in the water instead. Zoro immediately jumps in after him to rescue the non-swimmer, only to be run over by the Straw Hats' own ship. The marines are eventually defeated, but a fleet of nine more ships is still waiting in the fog surrounding the island. Zenii tells the Straw Hats that, on his arrival on the island, the goats ate all of his money and that they became his treasure instead. The Straw Hats give Zenii enough medicine to survive and leave the island, escaping from the navy. </Overview>

  <Overview>After escaping from another fleet of navy ships, the Straw Hats drop anchor outside a town with a huge tower. After they set foot on land, an official demands that they pay a harbor tax. The Straw Hats meet a scientist named Henzo, who asks them if they have seen what he calls the &quot;Rainbow Mist.&quot; The other citizens of the town dislike Henzo because they have to pay high taxes to fund for his research. While shopping with Nami and Chopper, Sanji has a violent encounter with a tax collector, who is wearing an electric battle suit. A large, unmanned galley appears in the harbor, in the same condition that Henzo saw it fifty years ago. Henzo, Luffy, Robin, and Usopp aboard it. Further out at sea, a rainbow-colored mist appears and the group uses the Straw Hats' ship to enter it. </Overview>

  <Overview>Inside the mist, Luffy and his group discover a large ship graveyard. Luffy salvages a chest filled with gold and jewels from one of the shipwrecks, but a distant voice tells him to return the treasure and leave the mist. Usopp believes the voices to be ghosts, but they actually originate from a group of children who call themselves the Pumpkin Pirates. In his youth, Henzo was a member of this group, and they are the reason for his research. He spent his life in search of a means to rescue them from the Rainbow Mist. Only a short time earlier from their point of view, but fifty years earlier from Henzo's perspective, a group of pirates, led by a Captain Whetton, attacked the children's town. When Whetton came after the children, they tried to escape by stealing the pirates' ship. During the fight, Whetton smashed the ship's helm, and Henzo jumped overboard, taking Whetton with him, while the other children sailed into the mist. </Overview>

  <Overview>After entering the Rainbow Mist, the children followed the orders of Ian, the only pirate left on the ship. He mistreated them and they eventually locked him up in the brig of the wreck of a navy ship. Luffy and his group try to escape the mist, but they soon realize that they need help. The Straw Hats persuade one of the children to lead them to the Pumpkin Pirates' hiding place so they can ask them for a way out. Usopp prepares a steaming meal, which causes most of the children to like the Straw Hats; however, their leader, Lapanui, remains suspicious and unwilling to help. Henzo's snail-o-phone rings and the son of Whetton wants Henzo to investigate the mist, not knowing that the professor is already inside the mist. When Lapanui hears Whetton's name, he loses what little he trust has for Henzo. </Overview>

  <Overview>Lapanui accuses Henzo of being Whetton's lapdog and says that in the past, Henzo would have never allowed that to happen. Usopp tells Lapanui that Henzo had endured the same insults from the townspeople yet still tried to rescue the children. Then, for no apparent reason, Luffy slingshots himself and Lapanui to another part of the mist. At the harbor, Nami ties a long lifeline, prepared by Henzo, to a boat and enters the Rainbow Mist. Once inside, Ian, who convinced one of the children to release him, steals the boat and escapes. He reaches Whetton and describes to him the mist's treasures. Whetton orders his men to invade the mist. The town's large tower falls into the water, creating a bridge from the island into the mist, and Whetton and his men cross it to attack. </Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy and Lapanui are outside the mist and use the newly created bridge to re-enter it. There, Luffy fights Whetton and, as it becomes clear that he cannot defeat Luffy face-to-face, Whetton detonates the tower, trapping everyone else inside and Whetton's abandoned men join forces with Luffy's group. An exit appears in the distance and they row toward it, but it closes too fast for them to reach it. Hoping to generate enough wind to blow the Straw Hats' ship clear of the mist, Lapanui stays behind to destroy the navy ship's armory. The other children follow him, promising to meet Henzo again. The explosion they cause successfully blows the Straw Hats' ship outside the mist. There, a group of navy ships, led by an aged Lapanui, arrives and confiscates the Rainbow Mist's treasures from Whetton and takes him and his men into custody. </Overview>

He then told the judge that he would accept the punishment for both his previous crime and the recent attack. Franky tried to stop the train to Enies Lobby with his bare hands. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats and their allies are about to reach Enies Lobby. Galley-La foreman Paulie sketches the island's terrain and explains that, to save Robin, the crew must reach her before she passes through the Gate of Justice. Because the Straw Hats are the only ones capable of matching the CP9 in combat, the Franky Family and the Galley-La foremen plan to charge in first and open the island's gates to allow the Straw Hats to rush in riding the sea train. As Enies Lobby draws near, the gigantic Gate of Justice appears in the sky behind it. While his crewmates and allies gaze in awe, Luffy ignores the plan and strides past the first of the gates. On the other side of the island, in the Tower of Justice, Chief Spandam and the second half of CP9 await the arrival of Rob Lucci's group and their prisoners. </Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy easily gets past the second gate, while the Franky Family and the Galley-La foremen, following their initial plan, break the first gate's defenses. All goes smoothly at first, but by the time the Franky Family's main force reaches the second gate, the marines have called for help. The giants Oimo and Kāshī, the island's front gate gatekeepers, take up their posts. Overmatched in strength and size, the Franky Family send their best fighters, the Kairiki Destroyers. However, even these overly large humans can do little against the giants' power and are quickly defeated. On the other side of the gate, Luffy faces the collective might of Enies Lobby's 10,000 men. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Galley-La foremen and the leading members of the Franky Family arrive late at the second gate because they had to mount the Franky Family's king bulls, sea dwelling animals that look like sea horses, on caterpillar tracks. Combining forces, they manage to pin down Kāshī against a wall. Then, taunting Oimo, they goad him into hitting his partner in the face, knocking Kāshī unconscious. In the Tower of Justice, Spandam receives an incomplete report about Luffy, which leads him to believe that the enemy captain is not a threat. Lucci's party arrives and the CP9 celebrate their reunion with petty bickering and a contest of strength. Meanwhile, Luffy, defying resistance, makes his way towards the Courthouse Plaza. </Overview>

  <Overview>Robin and Franky are brought before Spandam, while Luffy blasts through waves of marines. The Galley-La foremen and the Franky Family eventually slip by Oimo and open the second gate. However, their joy is short-lived, as a group of marines closes the first gate behind them. To overcome the unanticipated obstacle, Zoro changes the plan. Yokozuna bends the island's outside fence downward. Using it as a ramp, the sea train jumps over both of the gates and crash lands into Oimo's back, finishing him off, and concluding everyone's arrival at the main island. As the elite group—called Law's Watch Dog Unit—enters the fight on the side of the marines, the battle escalates in intensity. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats struggle to catch up with Luffy, but get caught up in impeding each other's efforts; Sanji and Zoro indulge themselves in petty bickering and Nami injures her crewmates by testing her newly improved weapon. The streets appear empty, abandoned by the men who were fighting Luffy. Just then, the Law's Watch Dog Unit and a large group of other men step into their way. A fight seems inevitable until their allies, riding the king bulls, arrive. Paulie uses his ropes to pull the crew onto the back of one of the large animals. Then the Galley-La foremen replace Straw Hats' in battle to allow the rest of the group to escape. </Overview>

  <Overview>Oimo explains to Sogeking about how he and Kāshī came to support the marines—the marines told them that they arrested their bosses. The story reminds Sogeking of the giants Dorry and Broggy, whom the Straw Hats met shortly after entering the Grand Line. Sodom the king bull incurs severe damage and urges the Straw Hats riding him to continue without him. Quickly, they board Sodom's brother Gomorrah and continue on. Atop of the courthouse, the fight between Blueno and Luffy begins. Luffy throws the first punch and seems far less inferior than during their last encounter. </Overview>

  <Overview>Kokoro and her granddaughter Chimeney contact the Straw Hats by means of Nami's portable transponder snail phone. They inform them of Luffy's location and instruct them on how to lower the courthouse's drawbridge. The Franky Family decides to lower it. Just then, the second of Enies Lobby's elite units enters the battle. One of the Guilty Jurymen throws his massive iron ball at Gomorrah, knocking him down. Behind them, Sogeking is riding to the courthouse on the shoulders of one of the giants with whom he has managed to ally. Gomorrah, arising again despite severe injury, tells those riding him to hold on as he plans to take them to their destination. Inside the Tower of Justice, Kaku and Kalifa hesitatingly eat the devil fruits that Spandam has given them. </Overview>

  <Overview>Although Gomorrah was blinded, he continues on. Sanji and Zoro crush a building in the king bull's path and the party arrives at the courthouse. On the other side of the drawbridge, Spandam is brought a transponder snail phone with an urgent report. Confident that he will only be told of the Straw Hats' capture, he allows Robin and Franky to listen in, letting them know of their rescuers' success. In front of the courthouse, Zoro cuts open the building's immense stone door. The Franky Family split into three groups, two of which storm the drawbridge towers to reach the levelers at their tops. On the courthouse's roof, Luffy and Blueno fight on even terms until Luffy activates his newest technique, the Gear Second. </Overview>

He uses his remaining cola to inflate his buttocks and with a giant flatus shoots himself and Robin outside, onto the balcony, and into Luffy's sight, breaking his chains in the process. Luffy wants to slingshot himself over the waterfall to rescue Robin, but she tells him to stay and that only she wants to die. In front of the courthouse, Yokozuna succumbs to the jurymen's attacks. The marines are about to pour in as the giants arrive and assume control of the position. Kāshī throws Sogeking onto the courthouse, where he joins the assembling Straw Hats. Gathering on the battlements, they face Robin and the CP9, while they wait for the drawbridge to be lowered. </Overview>

Other children ostracize her. Studying in the world's greatest library, the Tree of Omniscience, in the hopes of being allowed to help the local archaeologists in their forbidden research, Robin earns the rank of a scholar in archaeology at age eight. However, when she announces her intention to help, her request is denied because of her youth. Disappointed at being rejected again, she walks along the shore, where she stumbles on Jaguar D. Saulo, a giant and deserted vice-admiral of the navy. The two become friends and Saulo teaches her to laugh. </Overview>

  <Overview>Saulo is shocked to learn that Robin is Nico Olvia's daughter and that he has been washed up on the shores of Ohara. Olvia, who returned to the island on a stolen navy ship, hurries to the Tree of Omniscience to warn her colleges of a coming navy fleet. However, she is too late. The government ship that carried Spandam's father Spandaine and his men has already arrived. They frighten the island's population into boarding an evacuation ship, while the government soldiers arrest the scholars and search the library. Professor Clover, Robin's mentor, urges Robin to board the evacuation ship, but she refuses. As it becomes clear that the scholars will not be forgiven for their forbidden research, Clover asks to be allowed to speak to the heads of the government, known as the Five Elder Stars. </Overview>

  <Overview>Professor Clover is allowed to speak with one of the Elder Stars and reports of their research. He describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the world government assumed power. He considers the collective evidence, which leads him to believe that the governemt tried to erase their former enemies from history. After stating that Ohara has learned too much, the Elder Star orders Spandaine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island. Suddenly, the library is set aflame; while the scholars try to save the books, Robin admits to being an archeologist and unites with her mother. However, their union does not last long. Around them, cannon shots from the Buster Call's battleships start to hail down and Olvia sends her daughter off with Saulo to flee the island, while she joins the effort to save the library's knowledge. </Overview>

  <Overview>Saulo fights the battleships, attempting to allow Robin to escape. She tries to board the evacuation ship, but per Spandaine's orders, she is denied access. Vize-Admiral Kuzan, later known as Admiral Aokiji, enters the scene to engage in battle with Saulo. While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saulo, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saulo's argument and Sakazuki's action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy. Finally knowing what kept her away, Sogeking, on Luffy's order, burns the government's flag, declaring war. </Overview>

  <Overview>Franky had hidden the blueprints for the ancient weapon Pluton within his body. He shows them to the CP9, explaining that they were only kept in existence so that an opposing force could be constructed in case the other ancient weapons still in existence were revived by Robin. Having realized that she is not the demon that rumors characterized her as, he bets the world's fate on the Straw Hats ability to rescue her and burns the blueprints. Enraged, Spandam throws Franky off the balcony. Kokoro runs Rocketman up the half-lowered drawbridge. The Straw Hats, informed via transponder snail phone, jump aboard. Hitting Franky on the way and carrying him along, the train jumps over the waterfall and crashes into the Tower of Justice. </Overview>

  <Overview>Unburying themselves from the rubble their entry has caused, the Straw Hats are greeted by Fukurou. He tells them that in the tower, including himself, there are five CP9 members, each carrying a key, one of whom unlocks the sea stone handcuffs on Robin. He also tells them that Lucci and Spandam have already taken Robin to the Gate of Justice. The Straw Hats split up. Luffy chases after Robin, while the rest pursue the keys. Meanwhile, Chimeney and her pet rabbit Gonbe find a secret passage. As they explore it, their attention is caught by the villainous laughter of Chief Spandam. </Overview>

Eventually, Kaku makes use of his newly gained devil fruit power. He transforms into a giraffe, causing the floor to collapse. He and Zoro fall down a story, interrupting the fight between Sogeking and Jyabura. The fighting halts as everyone entertains themselves by making fun of Kaku's ridiculous appearance. Enraged, Kaku uses his new power to vertically cut the building in half. As the confusion subsides, Zoro and Sogeking realize that they accidentally handcuffed themselves together. Meanwhile, Luffy searches high and low for the Tower of Justice for Robin and her captors. </Overview>

  <Overview>Refreshed after having placed three full bottles of cola in his stomach compartment, Franky turns the tide in his battle with Fukurou. After breaking through a few walls, they continue fighting outside. They fall into the sea and by the force of the currents are drawn towards the waterfall surrounding Enies Lobby's main island. Franky barely saves himself from falling down by grabbing onto Fukurou's leg with his extendable arm. Unable to shake off his opponent, Fukurou is forced to use his air-walking technique to drag both of them towards land. As they close in on the Tower of Justice, he attempts to crush Franky into it. However, Franky is prepared, and holds onto his opponent with his dividable legs and uses his air pressure cannon to propel him flying into the ground. </Overview>

  <Overview>Chopper's breather concludes as Kumadori frees himself from the fridge, apparently after he finished eating its contents. At first, he is fat, but he digests all the food immediately and is slim again. Fascinated, Chopper asks how he did it. Kumadori willingly explains. Afterwards, the two resume their fight where it had stopped. Chopper quickly realizes that he cannot break through Kumadori's body-hardening technique without the effect of his Rumble Ball drug. Having used a first while rescuing Nami, he dares not use a second out of fear of its side effects. Nevertheless, he takes it. Chopper charges repeatedly, but his transformations are erratic and difficult to control. By the time he assumes the correct form, he is too weak and is struck down. Left with one choice, he steps into the forbidden realm of taking a third Rumble Ball. </Overview>

  <Overview>In the Edo period-based alternate reality Grand Jipangu, the small girl Rika takes an ill person, whom everyone calls Tot-san (which means &quot;father&quot; in Japanese), to her house to nurse him back to health. Organized crime boss Buggy the Clown and one of the town's highest officials scheme to get rid of Detective Luffy. Mistaking Rika to be the daughter of Tot-san, Buggy kidnaps her to collect Tot-san's debt. When Luffy comes to rescue her, the high official attempts to exile him for attacking an innocent citizen. Instead, he himself is stripped of his position for joining forces with criminals by the shogun's daughter Vivi. </Overview>

  <Overview>It is the seventh day of the new year in Grand Jipangu. Nami, Sanji, and Chopper are on their way to the shogun's castle, delivering a large quantity of rice cakes to be thrown from the castle. Most of the townspeople have gathered there, hoping to catch the one cake containing a precious jewel. Buggy and his henchmen have made several plans to seize the cakes, including the one with the jewel, before they reach their destination. Although his plans fail, Buggy manages to take Princess Vivi hostage. However, Detective Luffy shows up in time to thwart his efforts. In the end, the cakes are safe and everyone eats until they are satisfied. </Overview>

  <Overview>Having taken three Rumble Balls, Chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct driven version of himself. Kumadori goes all out to defeat his enemy, but in the end cannot succeed. In Kalifa's room, Nami lies helplessly on the ground, watching her opponent casually bathing. Slowly, the strength returns to her limbs while Kalfi redresses. Shortly into their fight, Nami discovers the essence of Kalifa's new ability. Being a soap woman, she can create a foam that washes away anything, even a person's strength. Chopper goes on a rampage and, with Franky on his heels, climbs the tower's outside walls. Having crossed the underground passage, Luffy finally catches up to Lucci. </Overview>

  <Overview>On the Courthouse Plaza, the marines defeat Oimo and Kāshī and capture the Straw Hats' allies in the courthouse. Almost on the Bridge of Hesitation, which leads through the Gate of Justice, Spandam tries to contact the CP9 members at the tower, but accidentally invokes a Buster Call, causing ten battleships and five vice-admirals to be dispatched to Enies Lobby from the nearby navy headquarters. Realizing his first mistake, Spandam makes another by informing the whole island of the coming threat. Out of fear, the island's 10,000 soldiers leave their prisoners and flee to the coast. </Overview>

  <Overview>Lucci and Luffy begin their mutually anticipated duel, while Nami and Kalifa's fight enters the next phase. Both combatants have scouted out each other's abilities. Kalifa attempts to finish Nami off. Just then, Chopper, in his monstrous form, crushes through the wall and enters the fight. He does not recognize Nami, just as he did not recognize Franky. As he goes through the room, he rips out Kalifa's large bathing tub and throws it downstairs, where the immobilized Sanji is sitting. Nami is deeply worried about Chopper, but before she can help him, she has to finish her fight. The torn up water pipes sprinkling the room's air provide a possible advantage for her. </Overview>

  <Overview>The fight between Nami and Kalifa climaxes. Kalifa sweeps the room with a tidal wave of power-draining bubbles to counter Nami's illusions. Barely escaping, Nami manages to prepare and release her finishing blow in the form of a horizontal lighting bolt. Franky, who had followed Chopper in climbing up the walls of the Tower of Justice, arrives as she is about to retrieve Kalifa's key. A moment's discussion later, they conceive of a plan. They follow Chopper into the room where Zoro and Sogeking, still cuffed together, try to fight Kaku and Jyabura. There, Franky uses his air pressure cannon to blast Chopper outside and into the sea, while Nami uses Kalifa's key to release Zoro and Sogeking from their shackles. </Overview>

  <Overview>Having pulled the once-again tiny, but now completely unconscious, Chopper out of the sea, Franky ponders on how he can cross the wild waters to reach the Bridge of Hesitation. Chimeney and Gonbe appear outside the secret passage and lead him to Kokoro and the underground tunnel. In the last remaining fight at the Tower of Justice, Zoro and Kaku exchange heavy blows, while Jyabura takes on Sogeking and Nami. The latter fight ends quickly, as Jyabura, holding the unmoving body of Sogeking, aims his killing blow. Just then, Sanji, freed from the influence of Kalifa's power by the water of the bathtub that Chopper had thrown downstairs earlier, steps in, taking his place in the fight. </Overview>

  <Overview>Nami drags the wounded Sogeking from the fighting zone. As she is on the verge of going downstairs, Sogeking has an idea. Meanwhile, Sanji starts exchanging blows with Jyabura, who sends him flying into the hallway. Continuing their fight there, Jyabura tries in vain to trick Sanji with a made-up story of being Robin's long-lost brother. The battle seems even, until the wolf-man gains the upper hand over his opponent with well-placed blows. Realizing that he is on the losing side, Sanji resolves to use his newest technique. He spins around until his leg starts glowing red with heat, and defeats Jyabura in a fierce mid-air final. </Overview>

To do so, though, he has to get past Lucci. At the same time, in the Tower of Justice, Kaku shows Zoro the many tricks he can perform with his body that is now equipped with devil fruit powers, discovering new techniques in the process. </Overview>

  <Overview>After many failed attempts, Zoro finally cuts Kaku. Shortly afterwards, their fight climaxes, as both combatants use their ultimate techniques. The victor is Zoro. On the other side of the raging waters, on the Bridge of Hesitation, Spandam continues to drag Robin along. Fear strikes her as the end of the bridge, which for her marks the point of no return, comes into sight. She pulls herself free and runs away. Spandam pursues and recaptures her, but she holds on to the rim of the bridge with her teeth. Below them, Franky tries in vain to force his way past the much more powerful Lucci. As Franky is on the verge of being killed, Luffy activates Gear Second and attacks Lucci, allowing Fanky to slip by. </Overview>

  <Overview>Having loosened Robin's tooth grip on the bridge's rim, Spandam ties a rope around her waist and pulls her further along; during this, he constantly insults her and proudly tells her that Spandaine, the man who had caused her so much suffering, is his father. A stream of tears runs down her cheeks as her time runs out. Just then, and seemingly out of nowhere, an explosive projectile hits the back of Spandam's head. A stream of projectiles falls on the marines gathered around him. Outside the range of normal guns, Sogeking is shooting at them, standing on top of the Tower of Justice. </Overview>

  <Overview>Freed from her sea stone handcuffs by Franky, Robin returns to her normal self. With no way back, the two decide to capture the ship Spandam had intended to use to bring Robin to the navy headquarters. The Buster Call ships arrive and start by shooting at the Tower of Justice, causing its dangerously positioned upper half to crush down into the waterfall. The resulting loud noise created reaches Luffy and Lucci beneath the Bridge of Hesitation. Anticipating that the Straw Hats would emerge through the underground passage, Lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber, flooding it and the passage. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Buster Call ships have reached the island. Guns blazing, they pass the Bridge of Hesitation. At the same time, the remaining Straw Hats, Kokoro, Chimeney, and Gonbe have entered the underground passage and are running towards the water streaming in on the other end. Meanwhile, Luffy and Lucci, having fled from the rising water, continue their fight a few levels higher. Because the effects of his Gear Second have worn off, Luffy is at a disadvantage. However, he has another trump card: he activates Gear Third, blows air into his arm until it reaches the size of that of a giant, and knocks Lucci out of the pillar. </Overview>

  <Overview>Fifteen years into the past, a 13-year-old Rob Lucci, as emissary of the world government, is sent into a country at war with pirates. Five hundred of their soldiers have been taken hostage and the pirates' captain demands the throne in exchange for the men's life. The country's king is close to giving in when Lucci arrives. However, Lucci has not come to offer help, but to take matters into his hands. He goes to the pirates and allows them to capture him. They lock him up with the five hundred soldiers. Lucci kills them all, in the name of justice, because for a soldier it is a sin to be weak. Afterwards, he kills the pirates' captain and ends the country's crisis. </Overview>

  <Overview>After fighting Lucci in Gear Third for a minute, Luffy is left to cope with the technique's side effect of his body shrinking to a fraction of its original size for around the same time. At the other end of the Bridge of Hesitation, Franky takes on Funkfreed, Spandam's sword infused with the powers of a devil fruit, which allow it to partly or completely turn into an elephant. At the islands entry, the two giants arrive, carrying the Galley-La foremen and the Franky Family on their shoulders. Instead of finding a means of escape, however, they are greeted by the cannon muzzles of three of the Buster Call's battleships. Equally desperate is the situation in the underground passage, where the group has been caught in the flooding-in water. Just as they are about to give up hope, a mermaid comes to their rescue. </Overview>

  <Overview>Franky and Robin are throwing the last remaining marines off their commandeered convoy ship when Kokoro, in mermaid form, jumps out of the water and on board, carrying the whole group from the underground passage. A moment of happiness arises as they reunite with Robin, but does not last long. The battleships have set the whole island aflame and via loudspeaker a voice announces the destruction of the group of escapees at the main gate. With no more targets left, the fleet turns its attention toward the Bridge of Hesitation, where the Straw Hats are forced to wait for their captain's arrival. </Overview>

  <Overview>Familiar voices are heard from the navy's loudspeakers. Calling in from the far side of the island, the Franky Family and Galley-La foremen are telling them that they survived and have found a means of escape. The Straw Hats are not so fortunate. Their stolen convoy ship is blown up by a salvo of battleship fire. Another salvo destroys the second half of the Bridge of Hesitation, forcing the pirates onto the middle pillar. The situation worsens, as the marines see the state of Luffy. Worn out from the fight and from overusing Gear Second, he cannot move or run, as the battleships aim their mighty cannons at him. Things seem hopeless, until the group hears another voice calling out to them; they jump into the ocean. </Overview>

  <Overview>The voice had come from the Straw Hats' ship, the Going Merry. Sanji is the first to go aboard. To his surprise, nobody is there. The ship had made it from Water 7 to Enies Lobby on its own. The Straw Hats have little time to spare because the battleships have already taken aim at the tiny ship that has snuck in between them. They fire a salvo, almost from point-blank range, but miss. While absent earlier, Sanji found the control room for the Gate of Justice and set it to close. The large gate in its original position creates whirl streams strong enough to disturb the battleships' aim as well as their ability to maneuver, which allows the Straw Hats to escape. </Overview>

  <Overview>Sanji is buying groceries in the company of Chimeney and Gonbe. For lunch, they lead him to the small floating restaurant of a drunken old man. He is asleep and not easily woken, so Sanji decides to prepare something himself. While he is cooking, the old man wakes up and immediately recognizes Sanji's way of handling the carving knife, for he knew Sanji's mentor, &quot;Red-Leg&quot; Zeff. He insists that Sanji taste some of his cooking. Sanji is amazed by the flavor, but cannot figure out how the old man made it. Intent on discovering the secret, he searches the city for seasonings that might have been used. Perchance he gets to eat an onigiri made by the old man and realizes that he uses a special salt. The salt was created by Aqua Laguna. As the storm floods the lower parts of the city, it covers the buildings with sea water. In the following sunny days, particularly tasty residual salt is left on the rooftops. </Overview>

  <Overview>Franky, Iceburg, and the Galley-La foremen work throughout the night to build the new ship for the Straw Hats. Usopp spends the time practicing the manner in which he will convince his former crewmates to let him join again. The next day, the Straw Hats are summoned to the shore to receive their ship. On departing, they are intercepted by the Franky Family, bringing the new wanted posters of the crew. However, the true reason they came is that Franky has received a bounty as well. They fear that, should he stay with them, he might be captured once more and that they would not be able to rescue him again. Therefore, they beg the Straw Hats to take Franky with them, regardless of whether he wants them to or not. </Overview>

  <Overview>When the Straw Hats arrive at the coast, Iceburg shows them the ship, but Franky cannot be found. Iceburg gives his opinion: Franky is hiding because if he were asked face to face to join the crew, he would not be able to refuse; he wants to go but thinks of staying in Water 7 as his responsibility. On the other side of the island, Franky's men literally take the matter into their own hands: they steal Franky's beloved jammer-style swimsuit and attempt to lure him to the Straw Hats by passing it back and forth to each other. Midway, Sanji and Zoro seize him, put him into the Franky Family's shoot-anything-cannon, and have him shot in front of the new ship. </Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy tells Franky that, if he wants his swimsuit back, he will have to join his crew. However, this does not persuade him. To weaken his resolve, Robin uses her ability to grab Franky's testicles and pulls on them. Iceburg tells him that he only wants to stay in Water 7 because he has not forgiven himself. Franky's followers bring him his luggage. He rejects it, telling them to stay out of his affairs. During this series of events, Franky cries, apparently from the pain inflicted by Robin, who had stopped some time ago. Sanji and Zoro arrive in a hurry, reporting that Garp has returned and is on his way to capture them. Luffy then returns the swimsuit to Franky, who subsequently agrees to join the crew. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats set sail, even though Usopp has not yet returned to them, because Zoro had promised that if Usopp was allowed to return without his first words being an apology, Zoro would leave himself. Even if they wanted to wait longer, they could not, because Garp has arrived and under direct orders of Fleet-Admiral Sengoku starts throwing cannonballs at the Straw Hats' ship. While the Straw Hats fend of the cannonballs, Usopp arrives at the coast and tries to rejoin the crew as if nothing happened. Minding Zoro's words, neither he nor Luffy admit hearing Usopp's calling in the midst of battle. Only afterward Usopp realizes his fault and begs for forgiveness; Luffy tearfully reaches out and pulls him aboard. </Overview>

They name their new ship Thousand Sunny, and Franky goes to the engine room to activate one of its special abilities. Luffy says goodbye to his grandfather and Coby. Enraged by his grandson's audacity, Garp pulls out a gigantic iron ball and throws it at him and his ship. At the last second, the Sunny's emergency acceleration device activates and blasts the ship a kilometer away and outside Garp's reach. Meanwhile, the crew's wanted posters and news of their deeds at Enies Lobby circulate around the world. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Don reveals the power of the Heat Heat Fruit: the power to melt any substance. Zoro is no match against his anger and ends up imprisoned inside an ice cavern along with the other captured Straw Hats. They manage to escape thanks to some indirect assistance from Robin, who is still with Lil. Luffy's fight with Blindo and Canpacino ends in a draw when the two leave to calm down the Don. Puzzle finally overcomes his depression and resolves to follow Luffy, Chopper, and Jiro to Lovely Land to recover the pirate flags. </Overview>

  <Overview>The battle between Usopp and Perona continues; Usopp fires something at Perona's real body which seems to miss it, giving Perona the confidence to fight back again. This time she produces a huge hollow, at least four times the size of Usopp, which grabs Usopp in its mouth and won't let go, leaving Perona time to go and return to her body. She detonates it, but the explosion gets sucked into the impact Dial, which Usopp cleverly brought out. He uses this on a Zombie-Hippo which was sneaking up, breaking his arm, but he then reveals that he stuck Perona's arm to the wall; he wins the battle by firing hundreds of little moving fake cockroaches onto her, and then smacking her over the head with an inflatable ten-ton hammer. </Overview>

  <Overview>Zoro duels Ryuma in Hogback's lab, while Franky guards over the injured Brook. Neither Zoro, nor Ryuma, can gain any advantage over the other, as they keep matching the other's attack. Their attacks quickly destroy the lab, forcing them to escape the room and continue their fierce duel on the roof. As Brook watches on, he comes the conclusion that Ryuma was never taking their fights seriously. After an intense sword fight, during which the entire roof collapses to the ground below, Zoro finally defeats Ryuma using a technique which sets him ablaze. Zoro lands hard on the lip of the roof below. Ryuma manages to land on a higher ledge. Ryuma staggers slightly, then acknowledges his defeat at Zoro's hands. Sheathing Shunsui, Ryuma throws it to Zoro. Ryuma collapses in a bout of flames and Brook's shadow is finally returned to him, to his great joy. Zoro acknowledges Ryuma's skill as a swordsman and says he wishes he could have met Ryuuma before he died. He also agrees to forget the outcome of their fight. </Overview>

  <Overview>Chopper and Robin are outmatched by Zoro and Sanji's zombies, both of whom have almost completely lost the personalities they acquired from their shadows. Chopper tells Hogback that he had once respected him, but does not anymore after realizing the true nature of Hogbacks experiments. Hogback, however, argues that the zombies are truly alive, and recalls that he had fallen in love with Cindry while she was alive, only to have her reject him in favor of her fiancé. After her death, Hogback agreed to serve Moria in exchange for reviving her. Chopper becomes furious and attempts to attack and purify Cindry, but Cindry's strength, and Zoro and Sanji's zombies prevent them from doing so. Zoro's zombie and Sanji's zombie begin fighting each other, still unable to get along, and Robin tricks Hogback into telling them to jump out of the tower. Hogback orders Cindry to attack, but Cindry, having temporarily regained her original self, is unable to move. Elsewhere, Luffy is still unable to hit Moria, and Oars arrives at their location. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats attempt a &quot;docking&quot; maneuver by hanging onto Franky in order to form a &quot;Giant Robot Warrior&quot;, but it fails when Robin refuses to participate, as she considers it too embarrassing. The Straw Hats combine their strengths to get Oars off-balance and cause him to fall to the ground, enraging him. Brook is absent from the battle, as he leaves to find milk to drink to heal his wounds. Elsewhere, Nami attempts to find the treasure of Thriller Bark, but discovers that it is empty. Perona's subordinates load the treasure and food onto the Thousand Sunny when they see the Shichibukai Bartholomew Kuma aboard, looking for Moria. </Overview>

  <Overview>Moria's shadow escapes, leaving Luffy stranded in the forest, as some strange people reveal that they are looking for him. Zoro begins the fight against Oars, revealing the new 108 Caliber Phoenix with his newly-obtained sword, but Oars manages to avoid his attacks. Kuma informs Moria of the appointment of Blackbeard as Crocodile's replacement, and warns him that the Straw Hat pirates may defeat him, too. Moria refuses Kuma's offer to help him, and enters Oars' stomach to guide him against the crew. The crew realize that as Luffy failed to catch and defeat Moria, it is up to them to defeat Moria and Oars before dawn. Usopp runs to the kitchen to gather more salt to purify Oars, but Oars strikes out at him, destroying the passage to the kitchen. Brook, his injuries healed, manages to save Usopp and bring the Straw Hats a large bag of salt. </Overview>

  <Overview>With Moria's guidance, Oars is better able to counter the Straw Hats' strategies and turn their attacks against them. Franky is knocked unconscious after a failed attempt to fire himself at Oars with a giant slingshot known as Kuwagata and shoot him at point-blank range with Weapons Left. Nami arrives and joins the battle, but Oars demonstrates that he can somehow stretch his limbs, which the crew realizes is Moria's doing. Elsewhere, Luffy meets up with the Rolling Pirates, whose shadows have been stolen by Moria. They plant shadows into him in order to multiply his fighting strength and grant him new skills so that he can defeat Moria. </Overview>

  <Overview>Moria explains that he enabled Oars to stretch by stretching his shadow, thereby forcing his body to stretch along with it in order to ensure that the body and shadow are the same shape. Usopp fires Brook out of Kuwagata, with Robin making him spin and Nami electrifying him, but he only does minor damage to Oars and is knocked out when Oars retaliates. Robin attempts to use her powers on Moria, but he attacks her with his shadow and then switches places with it, rendering her attack useless. He then takes her shadow, rendering her unconscious. Chopper discovered that Oars died of frostbite, and that while he does not feel any pain, he can still take damage from their attacks. Sanji and Chopper launch a combo attack on Oars, who then knocks out both of them with Gum Gum Gatling, leaving only Nami, Zoro and Usopp standing. </Overview>

Usopp shoots Brook's salt into Oars' mouth with Kuwagata, but Moria's shadow catches it and throws it out, breaking the bag and preventing them from using it again. Oars tries to stomp Usopp and Nami, but Nightmare Luffy arrives and gets them to safety in an instant. While the Rolling Pirates take the unconscious Straw Hats to safety, Luffy begins attacking Oars, and with his shadows, is far stronger than his opponent. Moria attempts to escape, but Luffy punches him out with Gum Gum Pistol and sends Oars flying with Gum Gum Storm. The shadows leave Luffy's body, but he appears to have won. </Overview>

  <Overview>Oars recovers from Nightmare Luffy's attack. However, the Strawhats all get back on their feet, from Luffy to Brook, and launch a final devastating attack on Oars, which ends with Luffy smashing a Gigant Bazooka into Oars' face from above, breaking his spine and finally defeating the demon. Moria, however, gets out of Oars' stomach moments later, and prepares himself for his ultimate technique, Shadows Asgard. By sucking up all of the shadows of all of the zombies on Thriller Bark, totaling one thousand shadows, Moria becomes a grotesque monster, as big as Oars in size with short spindly legs, gigantic arms, and a huge bloated neck pulsating with veins. </Overview>

  <Overview>Zoro attacks Kuma, who reveals that he has eaten the Paw-pad Paw-pad fruit, and shows his ability to repel attacks, move considerable distances almost instantly and repel the air to attack his opponents. Zoro is quickly outmatched, and Sanji and Usopp's attempts to help him are rendered futile by Kuma's hard body and ability to block projectiles. Kuma then offers to spare the survivors of Thriller Bark if they turn over Luffy, but they unanimously refuse. He then detonates a paw print full of compressed air, devastating the island. </Overview>

  <Overview>While almost everyone on the island is knocked out in the blast, Zoro slashes Kuma with Shishi Sonson, but sees that it is ineffective, as Kuma is a Pacifista, a cyborg whose body is harder than steel. Seeing that he can no longer fight, Zoro offers his life to save Luffy, saying that he cannot hope to become the world's best swordsman if he cannot protect his captain. Sanji attempts to take Zoro's place, but Zoro knocks him out. As part of his agreement with Kuma, Zoro takes in all of Luffy's pain and fatigue, which Kuma says would kill him if he suffered it on top of his already severe wounds. Zoro takes in the pain, and Kuma leaves, remarking on how Luffy has a loyal crew. Luffy regains consciousness, surprisingly energetic, while Zoro emerges from his sacrifice near death. </Overview>

The next day, the Straw Hats celebrate their victory over Moria, but do not know why Zoro is so badly wounded. Sanji hears the story from the Risky Brothers, but prevents them from telling anyone else, saying it would trouble Luffy greatly to hear that Zoro suffered for his sake, but Robin eavesdrops on the conversation. Luffy tells Brook that Laboon is alive, and he is overjoyed to hear it, and begins to think about the time 50 years ago when he and his pirate crew first met Laboon. </Overview>

  <Overview>Brook recalls his past, when the whale Laboon started following his pirate ship and befriended the crew. When the crew headed toward the Grand Line, they had no choice but to leave Laboon behind because the danger the sea would present to a young whale like him, but Laboon followed them over Reverse Mountain, anyway. Brook and his captain convince Laboon to stay behind, promising that after they traveled through the entire Grand Line and he grew strong enough to follow them, they would come back and bring him on their adventures. They were unable to fulfill the promise, though. </Overview>

  <Overview>Brook recalls the Rumbar Pirates' journey through the Grand Line, where they faced many dangers but still managed to enjoy themselves. The captain contracted an illness and attempted to leave the Grand Line through the Calm Belt with the other infected crew, leaving Brook in charge of the remaining pirates. The journey continued until some powerful enemies defeated the Rumbar Pirates in the Florian Triangle, fatally poisoning them. As they were dying, they sang Binks's Booze one last time, recording it in a Tone Dial in the hopes that Brook would revive with his Devil Fruit power and deliver the shell to Laboon. Back in the present, Brook silently hopes Laboon will wait just a little longer for his return. </Overview>

Brook then reveals his insecurites to Robin, saying that he'll leave the crew if he proves to be only a burden. Robin tells him that she used to feel similarly, until the Straw Hats came to save her at Enies Lobby, and she had finally found her place. Encouraged, Brook later reflects on how he has found his place after decades of being alone, and resolves to do his best so that he can have stories to tell of his own.</Overview>

  <Overview>After the surprising reveal, Duval tells his story of living a peaceful life as a mafioso until Marines and bounty hunters came after him for Sanji's bounty, mistaking him for the Straw Hat, casing him to flee and wear a helmet to hide his face. The Flying Fish Riders attempt to drown Sanji by dragging him underwater, but the cook is saved by the intervention of Keimi. Duval then tries to sink the Thousand Sunny by having his men drop a giant anchor on it, but Franky reveals the Chicken Voyage reverse function to dodge it, and then the Gaon Cannon to wipe out most of the Riders. Enraged, Duval orders his pet bison Motobaro to gore Luffy, but Luffy stops the beast by unknowingly using haki, the beast goes wild and then faints, much to everyone's surprise. Sick of everything, Sanji takes things into his own hands, and sends Duval flying into his hut with a faceful of kicks.</Overview>

  <Overview>With the Flying Fish Riders taken care of, the Straw Hats rest as Hatchan treats them to the promised Takoyaki. Duval shows up again, not for revenge, but to thank Sanji since his kicks altered Duval's face to become handsome and suave, or so he thinks. To make up for the trouble he's caused, he leaves his Den Den Mushi number with the Straw Hats in case they may need his assistance before departing with the newly christened Rosy Life Riders. The Sunny sets sail for the Sabaody Archipelago, the stepping stone to Fishman Island. Hatchan explains that one needs to have their ship coated with a bubble resin in order to travel underwater, and once they reach Sabaody, he promises to find them a ship coater that he trusts. He also warns them that the world nobility will be on the island, and no matter what happens, not to touch them, even if they witness a murder.</Overview>

  <Overview>The crew splits up in order to explore the archipelago. Hatchan, Keimi, and Paggag lead Luffy, Chopper, and Brook to find the mechanic Hatchan spoke of. In town, they witness a disturbance caused by a man claiming to be an escaped slave yelling for help in getting an iron collar off. To the Straw Hats' horror, the collar explodes, severly injuring the man. Two people wearing gaudy clothing and bubble helmets, Saint Roswald and his daughter Saint Shalulia arrive and callously shoots his body twice before leaving him for the Marines to pick up. Paggag later explains that they were part of the Celestial Dragons, descendants of the founders of the World Government, and that they have the power to summon one of the three Admirals if they so please.</Overview>

  <Overview>After fighting their way through bounty hunters, Luffy's group arrives at a bar owned by a woman named Shakuyaku, an old friend of Hatchan's. The mechanic, Rayleigh, is not there, so Shakky suggests that they go searching for him at the Sabaody Amusement Park, but not before warning them to be careful, as right now there are nine other pirates on the Archipelago with bounties over 100,000,000 Beli. In addition to Luffy and Zoro, they are: Capone Gang Bege, Jewelry Bonney, Basil Hawkins, Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, Dies Drake, Urouge, Killer, and Trafalgar Law. Together, the group is known as the Eleven Supernovas.</Overview>

  <Overview>Duval and his crew arrive on the archipelago and start gathering the Straw Hats up to bring them to the Human Auction House, where the kidnappers have brought Keimi. Robin tells Nami why the Fishmen and Merpeople are not welcome on the island as in the past they had been discriminated against and classified as just fish. At the auction house itself await Saint Roswald and Saint Shalulia, as well as Trafalgar Law, Eustass Kid, and their crews. Backstage are Keimi and the other human merchandise, including the coating mechanic, Silvers Rayleigh, former first mate of Gold Roger himself.</Overview>

  <Overview>The human auction finally begins, and it is only then that the Straw Hats discovered that their mermaid friend is being sold off at Grove 1. After rendezvousing there (save for Zoro, Luffy, Brook, and Robin), their initial plan to extract Keimi is thwarted upon learning that the World Government and the Celestial Dragons are involved in the slave trade, so Nami decides that they'll buy Keimi back in the auction itself. Meanwhile, the rest of the archipelago receives news that the World Government is going to execute the captured Portgas D. Ace, a move that could provoke a war with Whitebeard.</Overview>

The proceedings are then interupted when Luffy and his Flying Fish crash into the auction house, but he is restrained from rushing the stage by Hatchan, who accidentally reveals his Fishman nature in the process. While the nobility recoils in disgust, Charloss shoots him, gloating about obtaining a Fishman slave. Luffy snaps and punches the man in the face.</Overview>

  <Overview>Sentomaru lets out that Kuma's powers send people flying through the air for days, and that Luffy should give up on ever seeing Zoro again. Kuma's motivations become questionable when he vanishes the Pacifista, gives Rayleigh some secret information, and refuses to explain himself to Kizaru. He then goes after each of the Straw Hats, vanishing them one-by-one before Luffy's helpless eyes. Brook falls trying to protect Usopp and Sanji, Usopp falls as he tries to get away, Sanji falls when he attacks in retaliation, Franky falls when he tries to get past Kuma, Nami falls as she pleads to Luffy for help, Chopper falls as he continues his mindless rampage, and Robin falls as she tries to flee. Luffy breaks down sobbing at the realization that he's alone and he failed his crew, as Kuma tells him that they will never meet again before vanishing him too. The Straw Hat Pirates have been completely annihilated.</Overview>

  <Overview>In a flashback, it is revealed that 20 years ago, a pirate named &quot;Gold Lion&quot; Shiki cut off his legs and escaped from Impel Down. A few days before the start of the movie, Gold Lion Shiki contacts the Amigo Pirates, a crew of pirates led by a man named Largo, offering to make them the 51st crew under his command if they fulfill a certain request. Meanwhile Luffy, Usopp, Chopper and Brook try to catch a large fish, but it ends up getting eaten by a large beetle named &quot;Boss&quot;. Luffy starts fighting the beetle with the intention of making it part of his crew, but it flies toward an island with him, Zoro, Sanji and Usopp in tow. Yoko, a girl wearing a Marine coat appears, attacking Luffy over how he treated Boss, and some people emerge from the island and reveal that they have been living while running from all threats, because the Marines do not protect them. Yoko's father was a Marine who died defending them five years ago, and she first met Boss three years after his death. They show the four Straw Hats their village, which strongly resembles East Blue to the point of having replicas of several prominent buildings. The villagers ask Luffy to bring Nami to the village, and as Nami heads to the village on the modified Waver, Largo's pirates head to the island to fulfill Shiki's request to get the beetle that left his hideout.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Straw Hats meet with people in places that remind them of where they came from, and Yoko becomes irritated at how easily they are bonding. The Amigo Pirates decide to head ashore, but because Largo is taking a nap, Colt leads them. Nami meets with the &quot;Orenami&quot; fan club, who leads her through a maze and shows her a naked statue of her, which offends her. She sees Yoko, and finds that Yoko reminds her of herself when she first met Luffy. While the Straw Hats are at a party, the Amigo pirates attack, destroying much of the village, and demand the beetle. Luffy easily defeats Colt and his men with Zoro and Sanji's help, but Largo traps him in a needled net. </Overview>

  <Overview>Bon Kurei frees Luffy from his cell on Level 5 and together they set off in search of Emporio Ivankov, the miracle worker whom Bon Kurei believes can cure Luffy's poisoning. Meanwhile Buggy and Mr. 3 attempt to escape from the wolves by enclosing themselves in a wax bunker, however the wolves prove too cunning for them and continue to hound the pair. After gaining dubious advice on Ivankov's location from another prisoner, Bon Kurei heads into the forest dragging the unconscious Luffy behind him in a cart. They are then attacked by a pack of Wolves. Bon Kurei attempts to fight but is quickly overwhelmed. An angry outburst of Haki from Luffy takes down the wolves, but the two collapse unconscious in the snow. They are then approached by a mysterious man, clothed in bright orange and white.
Back on Level 4, Hannyabal regrets being tricked by Bon Kurei who had assumed Nami's form, as he dangles bound and gagged helplessly from the ceiling of a nearby storeroom.
Bon Kurei awakes to find himself not in a frozen wasteland, but at a lively party populated by a variety of colourful cross dressers. Bewildered, he is approached by a woman dressed in the same orange and white as the man who saved them from the cold. The woman introduces herself as Inazuma and tells Bon Kurei that all his questions will be shortly answered. Suddenly a show starts, on the nearby stage a large man dressed in skimpy feminine clothes and sporting a large purple afro, welcomes Bon Kurei to the paradise of Level 5.5, The New Kama Land. He reveals they are in a sanctuary for escaped prisoners, unknown to the prison staff. As the show livens up Bon Kurei realises that this man is non other than the former Queen of the Kamabakka Kingdom, the miracle worker he had been searching for, Emporio Ivankov.</Overview>

  <Overview>While Ivankov is dancing around and joking with his followers, an intruder interrupts and declares that his father, once a king, one day paid a visit to Kambakka Kingdom - and came back a queer! Because of this, the king's country and family were ruined, and his son was reduced from his princely state to a mere pirate. He fires his handheld cannon in vengeance, but Iva uses his Death Wink to repel the cannonball shot back at him, then injects the burly man with female hormones and transforms him into a sexy female lady with huge female features. The intruder flees in embarrassment. After witnessing this &quot;miracle,&quot; Bon Kurei begs Iva to save Luffy. Iva leads Bon down a deserted corridor and says the only reason he helped them was because Luffy, writhing in pain, begged them to save his friend earlier. He has been under treatment for 10 hours. Meanwhile, on Level 5, Buggy and Mr. 3 are seen running away from wolves on stilts made from wax. Iva and Bon arrive outside a door that has been chained shut, through which Luffy's screams of agony can be heard. Iva informs Bon that Luffy still has 2 more days of treatment to endure. Meanwhile, Luffy, chained down inside the chamber, recalls the memory of himself and Ace as children, laughing and talking by a cliff overlooking the ocean. At the end it is declared that only 16 hours are left until Ace's execution! Will Luffy make it in time?!</Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy, Ivankov and Inazuma encounter an old enemy of Luffy; Crocodile. Crocodile wants to join them, saying he can create an escape passage in the ceiling with his devil fruit powers. Luffy immediately declines when he remembers who Crocodile is and what he did to Vivi. Crocodile says he has no more interest in the country of Arabasta. Ivankov accepts his offer, telling all of them that he knows a weakness of Crocodile. Then, from behind, Jinbei asks Luffy if he could join too, willing to sacrifice himself to rescue Ace. Inazuma opens up their handcuffs with his powers, and the two are out.
The five prisoners get up to level 5, using Crocodile's ability. They gather the New Kama army (including Mr. 2 Bon Kurei). Crocodile, Jinbei and Luffy, who headed up earlier, are already at level four. The three of them attack the Impel Down guards. As the guards are down, Crocodile heads up in the direction of one particular cell, the one holding his former subordinate, Mr. 1. Meanwhile, Ace is already on the Marine warship, being transferred to his execution ground. Also, Buggy and Mr. 3 are hiding at level 2.</Overview>

  <Overview>Jinbei, Crocodile and Mr. 1 finally secure a Marine vessel to escape with, meanwhile Luffy continues his fight against Magellan with the assistance of Mr. 3's Doru Doru no Mi powers. Though at first the pair are confident they can beat the Warden with their combined abilities, Magellan - seeing the situation is becoming desperate - unleashes his ultimate technique, Venom Demon, which is so toxic it can even poison Mr. 3's wax. With Luffy's wax armour rendered useless the remaining escapees flee to the entrance with Magellan directly behind them. It is then that Ivankov, who managed to partially heal himself with the Horu Horu no Mi, comes bursting through the ground with Inazuma using Hell Wink. By clinging onto Ivankov's enlarged head while he uses another Hell Wink, Luffy and the others are finally able to breakout of Impel Down and be carried to the captured Marine ship by a school of Whale Sharks summoned by Jimbei, all seconds before being caught by Magellan who stares on in disbelief.</Overview>

  <Overview>Oars Jr. goes straight for Ace! But the Giant Squad attempts to stop him without much success. Hancock finally steps into the battle and ends up harming both pirates and marines, as she doesn't distinguish between the two groups of men. And then Kuma unleashes an Ursus Shock which finally stops Oars in his tracks. As he falls to his knees he remembers when Ace offered him a form of shelter from the sun, rain, and snow by the form of a giant, handmade kasa. Determined, he gets back up again, and thinking he could at least take one of the Shichibukai down, ends up getting his leg cut off by Doflamingo instead. After one more shot from Moria, it seems as though this is really the end for Oars.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Pacifista enter Marineford as part of Sengoku's plan to win the war against Whitebeard. It appears that part of Sengokou's plan failed as all the pirates were to be inside the bay but Sengoku gives the order to attack all the pirates allied with Whitebeard outside the bay first. The Pacifista are then activated and destroy most of the allied pirates. Sengoku then goes on to say that the encircling walls should be activated once all video feeds are cut. However, the prisoners of Impel Down have captured one of the Den Den Mushi so that they could advertise their 'saviour' captain Buggy. Mihawk's battle with Vista is coming to a hasty conclusion and Luffy briefly encounters an admiral. The episode ends as the captain of an allied crew (Squardo) betrays Whitebeard and stabs him in the chest with a sword.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Squardo stabs Whitebeard, the pirates and even marines in the war are shocked due his betrayal. Squardo says that he knows about Whitebeard's plot on giving the 43 captains under his command to save Ace and the Whitebeard Pirates. He reveals that Admiral Akainu told him that, and for his betrayal, the marines would leave the allies alone, as the Pacifistas units advance over them, destroying everything in their path. As Sengoku's plan goes on, Admiral Aokiji freezes Buggy and his allies, to cut the broadcasting to the world. As an act of surprise, Whitebeard forgives Squardo, even though he was a &quot;foolish son&quot;. Whitebeard uses his powers to give a way out to his allies, and gives them the choice to stand for what they believe. All the allies regain force to fight, Squardo falls to the ground, realizing that he was tricked, and Whitebeard, the strongest man in the world, heads to battle.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ace starts to care for Luffy more as a brother after he was nearly mauled to death by a bear. Ace then sets off on his own 7 years later, bidding the moutain bandits and Luffy farewell. Dogra comes by a few months later and shows Luffy a newspaper that talks about Ace and his new crew. 3 Years later, Luffy sets out from the Goa kingdom. He then beats up the local sea monster for eating Shank's arm and to show the results of his forest training. Present time: Luffy proclaims that he is weak in front of Jinbe (and possibly the whole island), implying that he can't be the king of pirates like he wanted, considering that he wasn't able to protect Ace or his friends. </Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy along with the three princes try to protect Shirahoshi against Hody Jones, the captain of the New Fishman Pirates, focused on killing the Mermaid Princess but seems to have an ulterior motive as Vander Decken IX is slowly losing consciousness and his grip on his Devil Fruit powers that keeps the massive ship Noah from falling on top of Fishman Island and its occupants therefore killing them is weakening.
Meanwhile the other Straw Hat Pirates face off against the New Fishman Pirates officers who are equally eager to finish their opponents off as everyone prepares for the fight once again as the fate of the people of Fishman Island rests on Luffy's hands and his crew. As Luffy and the siblings deal with Hody, Decken falls after trying to throw his axe and passes out and the Noah starts falling to Fishman Island.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the Noah falls onto the Fishman Island, Shirahoshi desperately tries to tell Decken to wake up only for Hody to attack her but Manboshi takes the blunt of the attack. Luffy and Hody clash with Luffy sending Hody to the ship after receiving a bite wound. Hody, knowing that Luffy will have the advantage destroys the bubble on the ship leaving Luffy at his mercy but was saved by Fukaboshi. Fukaboshi then fights Hody himself and despite being heavily wounded in the duel demands to know why Hody is doing all this and what humans did to him. Hody smirks and gave him an answer which shocks Fukaboshi leaving him open and stabbed by Hody.
Shirahoshi following Fukaboshi's orders swims away with Luffy next to the Noah and Luffy receives a call from the Ammo Knights at the air tank saying that they have prepared a large air bubble to surround Noah, but stated that they've only got one shot available and it won't slow the ship down. Hody attacks Luffy again but Luffy destroys his Kirisame and sends Hody flying with his Jet Pistol imbued with Haki . Hody then shovels down more Energy Steroids causing him to grow larger and more enraged. Meanwhile, Fukaboshi, barely alive contacts Luffy and states he has discovered who Hody really is.</Overview>

  <Overview>The story goes back before the Noah started falling back to the island. Jinbe and Sanji continue to fight Wadatsumi and Wadatsumi becomes angry and inflates himself unknowingly crushing some of his allies. Sanji goads him into growing larger after saying he's smaller than Surume.
At that time, Neptune is greeted by some of his soldiers and the Minister of the Left and appologize for not protecting him. The Minister of the Right arrives at the plaza with some of the army and is informed of the situation and officially join the battle against the New Fishman Pirates allying themselves with the Straw Hats and Jinbe claiming they've made a terrible mistake for blaiming them. Hammond is using human pirates as slaves in his Slave Tank and Jinbe asks Robin to free them and she agrees. She frees them and easily defeats Hammond with her Double Clutch, breaking his back. The freed slaves then revolt against the New Fishman Pirates and ally with the Straw Hat Crew. The Minister of the Left gets in touch with the Air Tank and is informed of the situation and order an evacuation of the island and the citizens all attempt to leave the island.

At that time, the whole island can hear Luffy's talk with the soldiers, Shirahoshi and Fukaboshi stating he knows who Hody Jones really is. He states Hody is a monster born from their environment. He states the officers are all the same and how their just monsters born of hatred born from their ancestors and they fear their hatred will one day fade and so will their hatred towards humans and want them to be evil to justify their actions not even wanting peace for Fishmen. He recalls what he asked what Humans did to Hody and Hody answers &quot;nothing&quot; and that they've been chosen by the heavens to punish humans and granted power. He goes on to state that their hatred is not from beliefs or experience but they're nothing but empty opponents. At that time, Hody laughs maniacally and with blood-shot eyes he charges at Luffy and Shirahoshi.</Overview>

The remaining humans and New Fishman Pirates are being rounded up and caught by the Strawhat Crew and Jinbe, while Shirahoshi rescues a collapsed and unconsious Luffy from Noah's remains. However, if Luffy is to survive from his injuries taken from his battle with Hody Jones and his unsuccsessful destruction of Noah, the only thing that can save him is a blood transfusion, but the merfolk are reluctant to donate blood as it is forbidden in Fishman Island to give blood to a human.

  <Overview>King Neptune talks about the Ancient Weapons and Shirahoshi with Robin while Caribou listens and makes his way to Shirahoshi's room.
Meanwhile, Luffy regroups with the rest of the crew away from the party after Jinbe insists that he wants to talk to him and explains that Akainu fought against Aokiji for the title of Fleet Admiral on a certain island. Akainu won the title and Aokiji left since he did not want to work under Akainu. He then explains the two changes that happened in the New World after two years: Akainu becoming fleet admiral and Marshall D. Teach taking all of Whitebeard's territories and claiming the title of Yonko alongside Shanks, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaido. Jinbe also tells of a rumour that Blackbeard is searching for the strongest Devil Fruits so he can extract their abilities and claim them for his own use. Luffy does not pay attention to Jinbe's announcements and instead asks Keimi where Shirahoshi is, to which she replies that she is in her room.

Luffy senses a &quot;big animal&quot; in the palace so he calls Zoro and Sanji to come with him and they find Caribou using his Logia powers to capture Shirahoshi. Luffy kicks him out and Minister of the Right thanks him once again. The Minister of the Right wonders why the tower has been cut into pieces and Pappug says that Zoro did it and Zoro gets mad.

Meanwhile in Hody Jones's cell, Hody and his gang appear to be aged by the Energy Steroids and still want revenge against the royal family and humans. The Minister of the Left gets news that Baron Tamago and Pekoms, crew members of the Big Mom Pirates, are on Fishman Island. The Minister of the Left claims that Big Mom will destroy the island if they do not give her candy.</Overview>

  <Overview>The mermaids and Keimi from the Mermaid Cafe ask Madam Shirley if they can say good bye to the Straw Hats. Madam Shirley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hody and the New Fishman Pirates.
Meanwhile, Shirahoshi is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. Usopp and Chopper complains that they are going to die in the New World. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new New World Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. The Minister of the Left explains about the new Log Pose's features when Luffy suddenly grabs onto Nami, wanting to see the new Log Pose. She complains and says that she will tell the crew where to go but Luffy complains saying that he is the captain so he should decide where they should go. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and the crew does it.

The Straw Hats finally leave and some of the children of the Fishman Island ask their parents if they can get a Straw Hat similar to Luffy's and Jinbe says he will get some. Luffy then remember the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jinbe, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World.</Overview>

  <Overview>Heading into the New World, the Straw Hats (minus Nami and Chopper) are seen constructing something on deck. Inside, Nami is showering while Chopper asks if they'd be okay without her outside. Assuring him everything would be fine while deterring Sanji and Brook from peeking on her, Luffy, Zoro and Usopp set their eyes on catching a deep sea fish to eat. Knocking out the one Luffy had wanted, Usopp fires a makeshift fishing line into the fish's mouth in order to reel it in. Suddenly a two consecutively larger fish attempt to eat their predecessor on the line with the final fish being killed by Zoro who uses an upgraded technique.
Due to the extra weight of the fish, the Thousand Sunny is drawn into a nearby White Strom, where after being tossed around extensively they are then stuck by something massive and are ejected from the current, discovering a pod of Island Whales to whom Luffy and Brook mistake for as Laboon. Despite realizing they weren't his friend, Brook still chooses to play a song for the whales who then help them to the surface of the New World where they're thrown into a rough sea and come across several Marine warships.</Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Robin are standing near the dead dragon that Zoro killed and Luffy is trying to pull out the man who is stuck in the dragon's body. Luffy succeeds by pulling out only the legs, making everyone think that he killed the man. However, the legs are alive and they run away trying to look for a Shichibukai. Luffy runs after him and gets stuck to the legs after the legs fall on top of him.
Elsewhere, the Straw Hats who were captured by the people in the hazmat suits (Sanji, Nami, Chopper, and Franky) are in a prison cell and were shown to a gaseous figure known as &quot;Master&quot; who is very interested in Franky. They wake up minutes later in a cell and try to figure out how to get out. They then see a man's head which was cut into pieces and put it together. The head is alive and it tells them that his body was cut into pieces by a Shichibukai and he feels shameful for not getting killed after getting sliced.

Back with Luffy's group, Usopp sees a harpy girl on top of a burned down building, but after he yells for everyone to look, she disappears suddenly. They then approach a lake that separates the fiery and icy halves of Punk Hazard. Luffy befriends a centaur that thought that Luffy was one of his kind. The people of Punk Hazard who work for Master see Luffy's group and tell the harpy girl about them.</Overview>

  <Overview>Franky, Sanji, Nami and Chopper are surprised that the samurai is still alive after being cut. He is surprised that Nami talks in such a direct manner and dresses in revealing outfits but says that he likes it. He then finds out that they are pirates and says that he doesn't want to go with them because he hates pirates. He says that the reason he went to the island was to find his son Franky then blasts a hole in the wall using his Radical Beam and they escape, running into a room filled with giant children.
Luffy races against the centaur he befriended. Usopp contacts Brook and Brook tells him that Nami, Sanji, Franky, and Chopper were captured. The centaur gets a call from his comrades and they tell him that Luffy is the enemy. Luffy beats him up and Robin handles the other centaur that comes to help. The Straw Hats notice that the Den Den Mushi the centaurs were using had CC written on it.

The Master gets news that the Straw Hats escaped and that one of them can shoot laser beams like the Pacifistas. He also learns that they are in the biscuits room with the giant kids. He also finds out that the Marines are arriving and tells his men to send out poison gas to stop them from landing. The G-5 men start suffocating from the gas so they put on gas masks. Smoker then explains that the island was the battleground for Aokiji and Akainu when they fought for for the title of Fleet Admiral two years ago.</Overview>

  <Overview>Nami's group who escaped the prison cell end up in the Biscuits Room, where they find giant children. The children play with Chopper and Franky for a moment, but are scared when the samurai head asks if they have seen a boy named Momonosuke. The hazmat suit soldiers arrive and attempt to capture Nami's group, and the pirates run away. Meanwhile, Usopp makes a banana boat so Luffy's group can get across from the fire side of Punk Hazard to the snow side of the island. The centaur who Luffy beat earlier sees them, and tells his boss that the Straw Hats are heading to the snow part of Punk Hazard.
Back to the mysterious facility, Nami's group decide to stay and save the children, and defeat the hazmat suit soldiers. Meanwhile, on the frozen side of the island Brook is building snowmen and is suddenly attacked by the samurai's torso just after his snowmen are complete.</Overview>

  <Overview>At the lake, Luffy's group have been attacked by Brownbeard and his centaur unit who's job was to intercept and eliminate any obvious intruders.
In the lab, Chopper is fighting off the hazmat soldiers who were attempting to get into his, Nami and the children's way. Sanji and Franky continue to fight off their hazmat soldiers and discovers that they look like sheep. Meanwhile outside of the lab, Brook is seen fighting against the sword wielding torso and after trying to talk to it, gives up and runs away from it.

With the G-5 marines and Smoker, the group blasts their way into the island and discovers a hidden river which they quickly enters, unaware that the river was being monitored. At the Lab, a hazmat soldier warns &quot;Master&quot; that the marines have almost reached the harbor. Master says he doesn't want to reveal himself to them, but his accomplice says he will greet them instead. The G-5 Marines finally reaches the shore and after Smoker rings the doorbell the marines decides to blow the door open. This was interrupted when the door suddenly opens and out comes the former supernova, Trafalgar Law. His sudden appearance makes all the marines except for Smoker and Tashigi scared. Tashigi claims he is now part of the Shichibukai after Law gave the World Government 100 pirate hearts in exchange for the position. Smoker then demands to know why Law is on the island at all since no one is permitted to set foot on the island, to which Law calmly replies with that Smoker and the marines are not allowed to enter here either.</Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin try to get to the ice side of Punk Hazard but their ship gets capsized by Brownbeard. As Brownbeard's troop prepares attack them again, Zoro gets ready to destroy their bullets but gets dragged down by sharks. At the last second, Brook saves them and defeats Brownbeard's shooters. Once Luffy and the gang got out of the freezing water after killing the sharks, they opted to take the centaur's warm coats.
The Straw Hats who rescued the children attempt to go back into the building to find another escape route, but their &quot;hearts&quot; get switched by Law, making them swap bodies. Law then returns his attention to the marines and destroys their ship. The G-5 marines attempt to contact marine headquarters about Law but he takes away all their Den Den Mushi. Smoker then fights Law and warns his men to stay back from the fight unless they want to get cut to pieces (which they did). Feeling useless in the situation, Tashigi attempts to strike the Shichibukai but was promptly bisected.</Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy and Law agree on an alliance; the rest of the Straw Hats disapprove while Robin approves, even if she warns Luffy about a possible betrayal in a pirate alliance. Law switches Nami , Franky and Chopper's bodies again. Nami ends up in Sanji's body because Sanji is far away with Zoro and Brook . Law tells them that they can't go back once things start moving for example capturing Caesar Clown who has the Logia type Gasu Gasu no Mi. He warns them that he is highly dangerous therefore, they need Haki users to beat him. Luffy says that the Haki users there are him, Law, Zoro and Sanji. The marines are continuing their fight against Caesar's men. The three centaurs open the door and see a big glop of Slime that seeps out poison gas, most of them die and two survive so they run as it chases them. Caesar calls the pet slime monster Smiley and says that the Straw Hats and the G-5 marines are being used as test subjects for it. </Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy declares that he will capture Caesar. Law says he will deal with Monet while Chopper tries to find an antidote. Luffy and his group try to find the entrance to lab. Tashigi and Smoker attack Luffy, with Smoker gaining an advantage until Luffy uses Gear Second and tells Smoker to fight him later when he is at full strength. Back in the lab, the children start to wake up until Usopp puts them to sleep again. They then see pieces of Smiley falling onto the stolen warship. Franky, not being able to find an entrance, uses his Radical Beam to make an opening. The Marines try attacking it but discover that it emits poison gas when they touch it. One of them tries to burn it but it explodes when it catches on fire, destroying the ship. Back in the burning lands, Zoro, Sanji, Brook and The Samurai see Smiley shooting pieces of itself across the lake. Caesar then appears on top of the lab, explaining that Smiley was his experiment and that it is weak against water which is why it is shooting itself across the lake. After his speach, Luffy jumps up and grabs him. </Overview>

  <Overview>As the Underworld Brokers watched the video feed of the captive Straw Hats and Marines, Eustass Kid and Killer decided to ignore it for more important matters, such as forming an alliance between the Kid pirates, On Air Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates.

Law then decided to set his plan into motion and orders Franky to blow a fireball at a destroyed ship, creating enough smoke to block the cage from being seen from outside. Law then breaks free, explaining that he switched the sea prism stones with fakes during his stay on the island, and proceeds to free the others and restoring Tashigi and Smoker in their own bodies while securing their aid. Franky however had to leave them and protect the thousand Sunny. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami's group are still running away from Shinokuni and they manage to join up while escaping. Luffy's group managed to enter the Lab with the aid of Law and they opened the gate, allowing the G-5 marines to get in before closing the gate, but the rest of the Straw Hats were still outside. Seeing their only chance of hope closing, Zoro and Kine'mon effortlessly cut the gate open, getting everyone inside safely.  </Overview>

  <Overview>Though the Straw Hats and Brownbeard managed to escape into the lab, they left behind a gaping hole. But they soon realise that Shinokuni can now enter the lab. The G-5 Marines panickly seals the hole back up with various wooden and metal planks. They succeeded in sealing the hole as Shinokuni proceeds to spread throughout the island. Brook uses the power of his Devil Fruit to become a soul and survey the area outside of the lab, noting that 'it was like the land of the dead'. After regaining their senses, the G-5 marines then turn their guns and swords towards the Straw Hats preparing to arrest them. Nami notices Law and demands him to switch back her's and Sanji's body, to which Sanji secretly refuses. Law agrees to return them to their original bodies and uses Shambles to switch their hearts back. Nami notices that she was wearing a different coat and punches Sanji, accusing him for peeping at her body. Law then explains to everyone present that they only have two hours to escape, he then continues by saying the only passage that leads safely leads out of the island is called R-66 and is found in Room R. The marines were reluctant, but quickly changes their mind when Smoker repeated the order to them. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of the men and rescue the children as he goes to confront Vergo. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown is celebrating the deaths of his victims but notices that the cage has no solidifed bodies, which he needed to prove the power of Shinokuni. He also notices the absence of the G-5 Marines. Vergo states that Luffy and the others must have broken out of the cage and helped the G-5 soldiers escape. Before Luffy went to fight Caesar again, Zoro calls out to Luffy reminding him that this is just the beginning of the New World and he mustn't let his guard down again, and Luffy happily complies as he plows through the Satyr soldiers.

  <Overview>Caesar Clown, incensed with the humiliation that his prisoners escaped and are inside his lab, orders the passage between building A and B to be closed and Shinokuni to be let in to kill the intruders. Vergo, however decided to take care of them himself. Chopper, who was eavesdropping snuck out and tries to find his way to the children within the labyrinth that is the lab. Luffy, Smoker and Law were the first to cross the gate before the alarm sounded, indicating the gate is beginning to close. Tashigi instead heard the alarm and quickly ordered the G-5 marines to let the Straw Hats go and hurry towards the closing gate. When a wall was blown up in building A, Shinokuni flows in petrifying some marines while the rest hasten their escape. The Straw Hats and most of the marines got through the gate safety but a few stayed behind to help Tashigi across before the gate closes, losing themselves to the poison gas while their captain watches in horror. Caesar, angered that they survived, promised that no one will escape this lab alive.

  <Overview>Though most of the G-5 Marines got through the gate safely, they were attacked by the small dragon who after a while flew away in fear. The marines cheered as their beloved Vice Admiral Vergo shows up but that turned to horror when he brutally assaulted them. Tashigi tries to defend them from him, but was viciously struck down. That action was enough to cause Sanji to come to the rescue, claiming he heard her tears falling. The Straw Hats (minus Sanji) and Brownbeard were still heading towards the end of the passage until the small dragon shows up and begins to attack them while Brownbeard suggests that he keeps running. Chopper manages to run into Mocha who was still hallucinating and manages to defeat the soldiers trying to apprehend her and give her a sedative to calm her down. Chopper then pleaded for her help to prevent the other children from eating the drugged candy. Meanwhile, Luffy and Smoker were racing towards building C where they believed Caesar and Vergo were located. They entered the private room where Caesar was angrily ordering Monet to release the poison gas on the marines only to turn around in shock of seeing Luffy fist buried in his stomach, who declared that he won't let Caesar escape again. </Overview>

  <Overview> Smoker and Vergo begin their fight in the SAD Room. At the same time, Sanji, Tashigi, and the G-5 Marines are running through the battle torn B-block when a gas tank explodes, causing Shinokuni to be let in. Caesar Clown, sitting on the second floor of R-block with his subordinates in Vegapunk's old room, instructs that the doors to C and D-blocks be closed, driving everyone to the first floor of R-block where a trap is ready to expose them to Shinokuni. When one of Caesar's subordinates questions the nature of the gas, Caesar then makes a speech to his subordinates, saying that the poisonous gas bomb four years ago was Vegapunk's doing and that Caesar tried to stop him. However, in a flashback it is revealed that Caesar constructed the weapon himself, and when he was told to stop and banished from the science squad, he set it off. While the gates to C and D-blocks are closed, Luffy meets a small dragon who can talk.</Overview>

  <Overview>Monet was moments away from activating the self destruct button when she felt her heart being stabbed and collapses before dying. At the same time Caesar Clown stabbed the heart believing it to be Smoker's heart. The Straw Hats are still racing towards the exit of the collapsing lab when they felt the explosion of the SAD room and then saw Shinokuni on their trail. Smoker, seeing that they nearly reached safety, questioned Trafalgar Law of why did he possessed his heart the whole time. Trafalgar Law reveals the clever deception he played on the mad scientist where he returned the heart of Monet to Caesar without Caesar being the wiser.
At the tanker, Baby 5's missile attack failed to take down Franky Shogun and their duel began anew whereas Buffalo contacted Doflamingo of the situation. After confirming that the island wasn't destroyed as intended, Doflamingo decided to tend to the matter himself and is seen somehow flying over the sea towards Punk Hazard.</Overview>

  <Overview>Franky and his mech puts up a good fight against the two subordinates of Doflamingo and he sends them flying away with a portable version of the Thousand Sunny's Gaon Cannon, but the two refused to stay defeated despite their injuries.
The fight however was interrupted with the arrival of the mine cart filled with all of the lab escapees. Seeing that Law is allied with the enemy and that the odds are against them, the two decided to hightail out of Punk Hazard along with Caesar Clown in their possession. Before Law could stop them, Luffy told Law that Usopp and Nami will handle this. The two Straw Hats proved Luffy right as they easily stopped the fleeing pirates and succeeded in capturing Caesar.

Meanwhile, far away from Punk Hazard, Doflamingo is still flying toward Punk Hazard imagining what torture he would inflict on the brats, while elsewhere on a giant penguin, a mysterious man is wondering which direction leads to Punk Hazard.</Overview>

  <Overview>Chopper and the dugong make an attempt to go against Breed, but Breed orders the other animals to attack them. At that point Law, Caesar and Luffy enter the room and Luffy knocks the animals out. Law explains how he saw through Peto Peto no Mi's weakness, which requires the victim to actually hear Breed's voice in order to obey him. Breed uses his Devil Fruit to himself and manages to enhance his own strength and muscles and tries to attack Luffy and the others. However, his control over the other animals fades, which gives them the opportunity to work together and hold Breed still. Luffy and dugong throw a combined punch to Breed and manage to defeat him. Later on, on the Sunny, the news about Doflamingo's resignation arrive.</Overview>

To the spectacle of the entire Colosseum, the man removes the bag and reveals himself to be Jesus Burgess, the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, who gestures and cheers over the broken bodies of his defeated opponents.

Meanwhile, the Thunder Soldier takes Franky to a private place so they can discuss Franky's 'job'. While the Marines notice that there are several competitors in the competition, the blind man is revealed to be the Admiral, Fujitora.

  <Overview>Seeing that his true identity is exposed, Luffy tries to defend himself from Chinjao's devastating headbutts and Cavendish's irrational hatred while trying in vain to convince them he's &quot;Lucy&quot;. Luckily, Chinjao's grandsons manage to intervene and halt Don Chinjao's rampage before he gets disqualified. They convinced him that they should focus on the &quot;real prize&quot; and that since Luffy is in Block C, they can kill him in the ring without repercussions. Cavendish, however, intends to kill Luffy before the match and proceeds to hunt down Luffy, who escaped the fight and is hiding outside, hanging underneath the stands window.

At the Battle Royale, only 30 combatants remain in the ring with the numbers being further reduced with the defeat of Tank Lepanto by Abdullah and Jeet who are in turn defeated by Bellamy. However, much to everyone's disgust, Bartolomeo proceeds to urinate in the water in front of the audience. Hack sees this as a vulgar display and attacks him from behind, but somehow his attack was nullified and his arm broken and bleeding while Bartolomeo remains unscathed, leaving everyone who witnessed this shocked and confused at what happened. </Overview>

  <Overview>With Hack defeated and the remaining fighters reduced to 24, the battle royale is nearly over. Bellamy faces off Bartolomeo while at the same time Blue Gilly defeats Ricky. The bribed fighters protecting Elizabello II guard themselves from Blue Gilly's assault but were back-stabbed by Dagama who revealed that Blue Gilly was his partner, but Dagama secretly plans to betray Blue Gilly. However, the long legged martial artist never trusted the tactical schemer and quickly knocks him out of the ring.

Bellamy is currently struggling against Bartolomeo while at the same time, Elizabello II is cornered but is fully prepared to unleash his devastating punch. The audience heard of the fighting king's reputation and proceeds to get out of the way of his punch. When Blue Gilly moves in for the kill, the king delivers the punch at point blank, creating a destructive shock wave throughout the ring. When the smoke cleared, Elizabello II and Bartolomeo were the only ones standing with the latter revealing his Devil fruit and the former being defeated by that power. Bartolomeo is now the champion of the Block B battle royale.

Meanwhile, Franky is informed by Thunder Soldier that he too is part of an operation to destroy the SMILE factory but needs the cyborg's help in rescuing the workers held prisoner there. The toy soldier then prepares to tell Franky the history of Dressrosa. </Overview>

  <Overview>Upon their arrival to Green Bit, the group discovers a Marine ship that crashed and believed that the Marines had landed on the island. With fourteen minutes left before the exchange, Robin and Usopp begin to scout the island as Law takes Caesar to the meeting point.

As they explore, Robin and Usopp discover a squad of Marines who are getting attacked by the forest's inhabitants, losing all of their belongings. As soon as the Marines fled, Robin uses her Devil Fruit power to capture the fast and seemingly invisible thieves. Usopp asks her what she has caught, and she tells him that she believes they are dwarves.

Meanwhile at Acacia, Zoro has captured his sword thief, a dwarf named Wicca, who berated herself for being caught. Because the fall sprained her ankle, she begged Zoro to take her to the flower field to deliver a report that the Donquixote family is planning to attack the Straw Hats ship. Zoro had no choice but to take her with him due to his horrible sense of direction.

With Violet revealing her true self, Sanji was seen beaten and bloodied before Violet who was actually an assassin sent to interrogate him about Law's plan. Her Devil Fruit power allows her to look into Sanji's mind for the truth, only to recoil from seeing Sanji's perverted mind. Sanji, who was barely conscious, told her that he never doubted her tears, leaving her genuinely shocked, brought to tears by his honesty.</Overview>

Though Luffy is not harmed, his new friend is not as fortunate to avoid injury, and with anger, Luffy delivers a Haki infused punch on the giant's face, knocking him out of the tournament.</Overview>

  <Overview>The battle royale heats up as more fighters continue to drop one after another and the strongest and most infamous fighters begin to face each other. The standouts among the remaining infamous fighters include &quot;Destruction Cannon&quot; Ideo, Jean &quot;The Bandit&quot; Ango, the Funk Brothers Kelly and Bobby, the Flower Country's Hasshoken masters and naval warriors Chinjao, Sai and Boo, and finally Lucy, who is becoming a popular underdog.

The audience and commentator Gatz are a mixture of shock and awe by the power and brutality of each fighter's signature skills and techniques, and the question on everybody's mind is which one of these powerhouses will come out on top and earn the right to challenge the other three champions for the Mera Mera no Mi.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the Colosseum, Chinjao told Luffy that the King of the Pirates is one who conquers all the conquerors in the New World. He then started crying over his lack of memories of what Garp did to him and demanded an answer from Luffy who knew nothing about it.

Outside in the streets, Sanji and Kin'emon are watching Luffy's fight while observing in disguise the numerous marines surrounding the colosseum waiting to arrest any criminal that exits the stadium. However, not a single loser of the battle royales came out, confusing even the present vice admiral Bastille over what's happening inside.

Elsewhere, Thunder Soldier explains that ten years ago when Doflamingo took over the island, he imposed a strict curfew between humans and toys. Confused, Franky asks why would he separate them like that until the toy soldier reveals that every toy in the island were once humans who became forgotten to their loved ones and that Doflamingo brought a Devil Fruit user that caused those transformation.

At Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is barely holding his defense against Issho and Doflamingo's assault. Their battle is felt shaking the Tontatta Kingdom while the dwarves believed it to be Usopp's Haki. When Usopp questions their war with Doflamingo, the dwarves thought it was a joke and explains that 500 of their people including their princess are held as slaves in Doflamingo's dark factory and their goal is to rescue them and destroy the factory revealed to be hidden in the Corrida Colosseum basement, right underneath Luffy's feet.</Overview>

  <Overview>Luffy's battle with Chinjao rages forward as they both use Busoshoku Haki in the ongoing fight. During the match, Chinjao explains and then occurs a flashback when his head was functioning like a powerful drill. After some time, he lost a duel against Garp and had his drill suppressed in his head, which eventually was the main factor towards losing his fame, money and power.

After the flashback, Luffy and Chinjao prepares for their final showdown. At the ending, Luffy delivers a punch imbued with Busoshoku Haki towards Chinjao's head, bringing back its drill-shape. Chinjao falls unconscious and breaks the platform into two as a result of landing headfirst on it. Lucy is declared as the winner of Block C</Overview>

  <Overview>Sanji put up a valiant fight but was ultimately defeated by Doflamingo. Before Doflamingo could deliver the killing blow, Sanji was saved by Trafalgar Law who teleported themselves back to the Thousand Sunny. With Caesar Clown back in their control, Law ordered the Straw Hats to head to Zo immediately.

Though the Straw Hats were reluctant in leaving their remaining friends behind, they were forced to agree when they were assaulted by a flying Marine battleship, courtesy of Fujitora, and another one of Doflamingo's hand whips. Law reveals that Doflamingo cannot pursue them in cloudless areas with his Ito Ito no Mi and advises them to find one fast.

Once the Straw Hats escaped with Caesar Clown and the Marines heading to Dressrosa, the two Shichibukai have a showdown on the iron bridge. Law told his former leader that he is ending the alliance with the Straw Hats because once they stop the production of SMILE, Kaido will wipe out Doflamingo. Law also reveals his goal was to make Doflamingo pay for what he did 13 years ago, even if it cost him his life.</Overview>

  <Overview>After some conversation, Ricky reveals himself to be Riku Dold III, the former king of Dressrosa and Rebecca's grandfather. Many of the fighters in the holding cell show their respect to the former king, and Doflamingo's role as an agitator and arms dealer in inter-kingdom conflict is discussed. Suddenly, a thread of goo from the ceiling snares Sai and drags him up a tunnel, where Trébol, by unseen means, turns him into a toy and releases him out into the public.

In the flower fields, Gancho reveals to Usopp, Nico Robin and Franky the cruelty of the Donquixote Family from 800 years ago, and how the Dwarfs were slaved up until the rise of the Riku Family. The dwarfs all agree that Doflamingo's presence is a terrible thing for the country, and that an incident framed King Dold as a villain so he is undeservedly hated by Dressrosa today. Finally, the Thunder Soldier reveals that, before he was a toy, he was Rebecca's father.</Overview>

  <Overview>While the fight for block D continues, Thunder Soldier explains to the Straw Hat Pirates how King Riku lost the throne and respect of Dressrosa. Ten years ago Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers, asking for a 10 billion Beli ransom, in order to leave the country alone. Riku sent his soldiers to ask of the citizens' money, but while they were willingly trying to help their king, Doflamingo controlled Riku and his soldiers with his ability, and made them attack their own people against their will. In the shadows, Doflamingo and his crew are waiting for the right moment to interfere and act as a saving hero in the eyes of Dressrosa's confused citizens.</Overview>

  <Overview>While Doflamingo continues to control Riku Dold III, his subordinates manage to take control of the castle with the help of an inside spy, who also took princess Viola hostage. With the people's trust in him in tatters, and his spirit broken, King Riku begs for death. Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island.

After telling the Straw Hat Pirates of the tragedies of the past, Thunder Soldier explains that the king is still alive since Viola pledged her service to Doflamingo in exchange for the King's life. He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them.

In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren.

In the colosseum, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kin'emon with the help of Bartolomeo, although he was nowhere to be seen.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Luffy talks with Zoro and Kinemon, Bellamy begins approaching Luffy, saying he finally found him. Bellamy is about to attack Luffy, but begins having second thoughts. Just then, Dellinger interrupts him, claiming he has orders from Doflamingo to dispose of him, since Bellamy is considered a nuisance.

At the iron bridge, Law and Doflamingo continue their fight, with the latter having the upper hand. Diamante calls to inform his captain about Violet's betrayal, which Doflamingo had already figured out. He orders Diamante to send Lao G at the entrance of the factory to prevent the Straw Hat Pirates from destroying it, and handle the crowd's entertainment by himself.

The Marines see through Zoro's disguise and suspect that Lucy is in fact Straw-Hat Luffy. However, they seem to have no memory of the fighters that have been turned into toys.

The Straw Hat Pirates have a meeting via Den Den Mushi and share their knowledge so far. Sanji and his team decide to head back to Dressrosa and Franky asks permission to assist the Riku army's revolution, to which Luffy urges him to go all out.

While Admiral Fujitora arrives at the shores of Dressrosa, there is a big ruckus in the city, with explosions and buildings being cut in half. Doflamingo has Law beaten on the ground, right outside the Colosseum. He, then, takes out a pistol and shoots Law three times. </Overview>

  <Overview>Doflamingo lies to the shocked citizens that witnessed him shooting Law, telling them that Law was actually responsible for the morning's fake news about Doflamingo leaving the throne. When asked by Luffy what he is doing to Law, Doflamingo responds that Law was originally his subordinate and as such, it is his responsibility to &quot;educate&quot; him.

Zoro and Kin'emon attempt to save Law, but before the Marines make a move to stop them, Admiral Fujitora appears, blocking Zoro's sword and sends him underground, using his Devil Fruit ability. Luffy attempts to help, but is blocked by the Colosseum's bars, which are made of Seastone. The rest of the crew, who are listening to the events, are shocked to learn that Doflamingo has an admiral on his side. Fujitora and Doflamingo pick up Law and head for the palace, in order to finish their conversation. Zoro tells Luffy to find a way out, as they try to outrun the Marines.

At that point, Sanji's group is attacked by what appears to be a singing ship, which belongs to the Yonko Big Mom. On the ship are Tamago and Pekoms, who reveal that their goal is Caesar Clown.

The Straw Hat Pirates realize they have to keep their new enemies away from Dressrosa if they want to destroy the factory. Luffy gives the order for the Sunny to head to Zou, Sanji asks permission to return fire to the Yonko's ship and Franky leads the way for the factory destruction team. Finally, Luffy states in anger that they will head to the palace to save Law and defeat Doflamingo.

Meanwhile, a mysterious figure appears in the Colosseum.</Overview>

  <Overview>The colosseum D block battle is almost over with nearly 30 fighters remaining with Rebecca among them.

At the Hidden Harbor, Usopp learned from the dwarves that Thunder Soldier left the group in order to assassinate Doflamingo at his palace, leaving Usopp in command of the army much to his disbelief. Though they were nearly caught by some soldiers the dwarves easily subdued them and their clothes were given to Usopp and Robin for disguise.

Near the Harbor elevator, many soldiers were rushing towards the elevator to see the battle between Franky and Senor Pink, unaware that Thunder Soldier and a few dwarves were hiding inside a crate in the lift. Seeing no other way, Thunder Soldier assaults the soldiers in order to hijack the lift. During battle, he recalls his training of Rebecca to teach her battle instinct. He then declares his goal to restore Dressrosa to King Riku's rule.

At the colosseum, an unexplained event caused every fighter in the arena to fall unconscious one after another. Before anyone could speculate what happened, an unidentified fighter is seen getting up in the arena.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the dust clears, the last fighter standing turns out to be Rebecca making her the winner much to the dissatisfaction of the announcer and the crowd. Speculations of Rebecca cheating were thrown throughout the crowd but Rebecca was the only one who saw what really happened.

During the fight, Rebecca saw Cavendish fall asleep in the middle of the battle. Before the other fighters would capitalize on their sleeping target, Cavendish promptly woke up with a sinister face that promised torment for his enemies. In that instant, Cavendish moved like the wind, cutting down every fighter in his way. Rebecca however saw this and barely manages to avoid a fatal strike from Cavendish, who then fell asleep again.

Outside, Vice Admiral Bastille finished explaining to an officer about what happened in the colosseum as this was the work of not Cavendish, but his alter ego Hakuba, a dangerous man who eluded the marines years ago for his dangerous technique.

At the Palace, Doflamingo is standing before King Riku who is chained up. Doflamingo gloated that Viola's hope of the Straw Hats defeating him and freeing Law is worthless, as he had full confidence that his men will prevent them from breaching his operations and believes that Luffy is still trapped in the colosseum.

At that moment, Robin and Usopp have successfully infiltrated the basement harbor, and Luffy's group ran into Viola who wants to help them in entering the palace.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the Colosseum, Rebecca finds Lucy to tell him she is in the finals too, but notices that Lucy is different than she remembers. Diamante is also announced to be fighting in the next match.

Meanwhile, at the palace, Viola shows Luffy's group a secret emergency lift that was kept hidden even from Doflamingo. Though stairs were also available, the group prefer to take the lift up with Luffy acting as counter weight.

The battle at the Toy House rages on as Franky launches rockets at Senor Pink who took a missile on the face, in order to protect Machvise who was unable to move.

  <Overview>The destruction caused by Trebol was enough to bring the attempted attack on Sugar to a stop as the dwarves were rounded up and interrogated. The dwarves however were betrayed by their naivety and revealed Usoland to them, allowing Trebol to ignite the slime they were caught in. Leo survives and lands near Usopp and Robin who evaded capture. Leo weakly told Usopp that their plan must succeed for the sake of their captain.

At the Palace, Thunder Soldier was brutally kicked out of the lift by Lao G, and has a flashback of his fight with Rebecca over the false news of Doflamingo's resignation. At the Colosseum , Rebecca lies beaten by Diamante who taunts her over the death of her mother. Seeing this, Sabo told Bartolomeo to protect Rebecca. Thunder Soldier was later saved by his dwarf squad from Lao G, and the survivors told him that he must press on.

Usopp was skeptical that they would put all their faith on a simple toy soldier, but Leo reveals that Thunder Soldier was the first to be turned into a toy and not given a contract. It is why he leads the resistance and that his human identity was the legendary gladiator, Kyros.</Overview>

  <Overview>Doflamingo orders Pica to push Luffy and the others off of the palace. Doflamingo then unleashes his Birdcage, sealing the entire island in strings. The strings then latch onto people and take control of them, forcing them to attack each other. Pica then rearranges the whole island, levitating areas such as the palace and the Flower Field. Doflamingo announces a game to kill him to break the cage, unless they kill all of the people he is about to name.</Overview>

Robin, Usopp, Sabo, Koala and Hack head for the SMILE Factory while Bartolomeo holds off the freed toys, and Kin'emon leaves to look for Kanjuro. Franky leaves the Toy House and goes to destroy the factory while Trebol and Diamante regroup at the palace. At the palace plateau, Kyros abandons the group to go after Doflamingo. Rebecca contacts Luffy, asking about her father, and Luffy states that he promised to end this game and beat up Doflamingo.</Overview>

  <Overview>Zunesha, having been injured Jack's assault, almost fell, which prompted everyone to work together to patch up her wound. Robin prepares a bandage; Chopper collects herbs; Brook, Zoro, and Kin'emon collect wood; Nami looks at a map to find out how to reach Big Mom; Franky repairs some broken ships to be able to reach Zunesha's legs. A Silent Supercell, a massive thundercloud that appears suddenly without warning, approaches, which destroys the equipment supporting everyone trying to treat Zunesha. Before they fall into the waters, Luffy and Robin save them. Chopper is seen without a hat on, Luffy takes a lot of food then goes off to find Pekoms. </Overview>
